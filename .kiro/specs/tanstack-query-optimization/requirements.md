# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to optimize data fetching performance in the AI Tools Database by integrating TanStack Query with Convex. Currently, while Convex prepares data in <200ms, there's a 1-2 second delay before data reaches the client. TanStack Query will provide advanced caching, prefetching, and optimistic updates to dramatically improve perceived performance and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: TanStack Query Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate TanStack Query with Convex, so that I can leverage advanced caching and data fetching strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN TanStack Query's QueryClientProvider SHALL wrap the application
2. WHEN a Convex query is executed THEN it SHALL be wrapped with TanStack Query's useQuery hook
3. IF a query is already cached THEN TanStack Query SHALL return cached data immediately
4. WHEN the QueryClient is configured THEN it SHALL have appropriate staleTime and cacheTime settings for optimal performance
5. WHEN using Convex mutations THEN they SHALL be wrapped with TanStack Query's useMutation hook

### Requirement 2: Optimized Data Fetching for Browse Page

**User Story:** As a user browsing AI tools, I want the tools list to load instantly, so that I can start exploring without waiting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the BrowsePage loads THEN the initial tools data SHALL be prefetched before component mount
2. WHEN switching between search modes THEN previously loaded data SHALL be served from cache
3. WHEN filters change THEN the system SHALL use cached data while fetching updated results in the background
4. WHEN scrolling through tools THEN subsequent pages SHALL be prefetched before the user reaches them
5. IF the user returns to a previously viewed page THEN data SHALL load instantly from cache

### Requirement 3: Prefetching Strategy

**User Story:** As a user, I want related data to load proactively, so that my interactions feel instant and seamless.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hovering over a tool card THEN the system SHALL prefetch that tool's detailed data
2. WHEN loading the browse page THEN the system SHALL prefetch favourite IDs in parallel with tools data
3. WHEN a category is visible in the viewport THEN the next category's data SHALL be prefetched
4. WHEN switching to semantic search mode THEN the system SHALL prefetch semantic search dependencies
5. IF a user frequently accesses favourites THEN that data SHALL be kept fresh in the cache

### Requirement 4: Cache Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent cache management, so that users always see fresh data without unnecessary refetches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tools data is fetched THEN it SHALL be cached for 5 minutes (staleTime)
2. WHEN a mutation occurs (add/edit/delete tool) THEN related queries SHALL be invalidated automatically
3. WHEN favourite status changes THEN only the affected tool's cache SHALL be updated
4. WHEN the user is offline THEN cached data SHALL be served with appropriate indicators
5. IF cache size exceeds limits THEN the least recently used data SHALL be evicted

### Requirement 5: Loading States and UX

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback during data loading, so that I understand what's happening.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initial data is loading THEN a skeleton loader SHALL be displayed
2. WHEN background refetching occurs THEN a subtle indicator SHALL show without blocking the UI
3. WHEN a mutation is in progress THEN optimistic updates SHALL be applied immediately
4. IF a mutation fails THEN the UI SHALL rollback to the previous state with an error message
5. WHEN data is stale but cached THEN it SHALL be displayed immediately while fresh data loads

### Requirement 6: Performance Metrics

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to measure performance improvements, so that I can validate the optimization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the browse page loads THEN time-to-first-data SHALL be under 300ms
2. WHEN switching filters THEN UI updates SHALL occur within 100ms
3. WHEN hovering over tools THEN prefetch SHALL complete within 200ms
4. WHEN returning to cached pages THEN data SHALL appear within 50ms
5. IF network is slow THEN cached data SHALL still provide instant feedback

### Requirement 7: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migration to be seamless, so that existing functionality continues to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating to TanStack Query THEN all existing Convex queries SHALL continue to function
2. WHEN using ConvexAuthProvider THEN it SHALL work alongside QueryClientProvider
3. WHEN components use useQuery THEN they SHALL receive the same data structure as before
4. IF a component uses Convex's reactive queries THEN it SHALL still receive real-time updates
5. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled consistently with the existing error handling

### Requirement 8: Developer Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear patterns for using TanStack Query with Convex, so that I can maintain and extend the codebase easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new query THEN there SHALL be a helper function to wrap Convex queries
2. WHEN defining query keys THEN they SHALL follow a consistent naming convention
3. WHEN writing mutations THEN there SHALL be utilities for optimistic updates and cache invalidation
4. IF debugging is needed THEN TanStack Query DevTools SHALL be available in development
5. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN documentation SHALL explain the integration patterns
