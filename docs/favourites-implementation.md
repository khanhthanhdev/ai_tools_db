## Implementation Details

### Empty State
When users have no favourites:

- Displays helpful message
- Provides "Browse Tools" button to explore tools
- Clean, centered design with animation

### Favourites Display
When users have favourites:
- Grid layout with responsive columns
- Each tool displayed using `ToolCard` component
- Heart button on each card allows quick unfavouriting
- Shows all tool information (logo, name, description, tags, rating, etc.)

### Integration with Existing Features
- ✅ Works with existing `FavouriteButton` component on tool cards
- ✅ Uses existing Convex queries (`getUserFavourites`)
- ✅ Maintains authentication requirements (must be logged in)

## Backend Already Implemented
The following backend functions are already in place (from `convex/favourites.ts`):
- `toggleFavourite` - Add/remove favourite

## User Flow
1. User must be authenticated to see "Favourites" in navigation
2. Click "Favourites" in header navigation
3. See all favourited tools in a grid
4. Click heart button on any card to unfavourite
5. Click on any tool card to view details
6. Empty state encourages users to browse and favourite tools
